When I didn&#x27;t find the book, the kid and his grandma came upstairs. I told the kid to dig around in the closet. He found the book. It was thick and had a black leather cover. Then the lights started to turn on and off, and I knew that Hitler was here. So, I grabbed the kid and ran out of the room, but then I realized the gradma was stil sitting on the bed. Then I saw a dark figure come out of the closet and stand in front of the grandma. I knew it was Hitler. Then the grandma screamed and Hitler did some weird ghost magic choking thing and they were both gone. I ran downstairs with the kid and knew we could beat up Hitler if he came downstairs.</p><p id="ed2c3da2-17fb-4ac2-a187-c8b0a3b19e78" class="">Then 我 wake up.</p><hr id="211797e2-58c9-4cb5-a661-5146e23f1bf3"/><blockquote id="f73a65fa-afe9-4130-9d87-acba248dbb36" class="">Huh - Feb 22 2021</blockquote><p id="891b5fe4-cf13-4789-9266-c2379fb8ff6d" class="">So I was in my family room, where I always do work, then my mom is like hey you should film your pullups and check your form. I&#x27;m like ok, can you film for me? Then that white boi u know him comes in and he&#x27;s like ok i can film for you, and I&#x27;m like ok, so i start doing pullups. The first 2 were hard, then I readjeusted my grip, then the bar started swinging alot, and I feel like when I was at the bottom, I was essentially horizontal. Then the last one I wound up on top of the bar, and I&#x27;m like hey I did a muscle up, and the white boi was like haha.</p><p id="09f89fc4-55d4-4f3b-ad2e-a12171f80009" class="">Then I was like ok it&#x27;s monday, I don&#x27;t have anything due, let me take a break, so I walk over to our living room, but then there&#x27;s people going nuts? Then I see a bug on the ceiling next to a hole, so I air slap it. It turns into a different bug, and I keep slapping it until it turns into a wasp, at which point I slap slap slap it to death. Then the people stop going nuts. I then help this woman un-nuts everyone, and the final person is a wizard who was her boyfriend I think? They fell asleep on my couch.</p><p id="025b62f0-5326-48b6-9534-fbf4454db96e" class="">Anyways, then I left, and I&#x27;m walking on Huntsmill Ave with the white boi and some other neighbours, and then I remember it&#x27;s tuesday after 9am and I realize I had a small calc thing due. Then I realize I had a big calc thing and another algebra thing. I panic because math doesn&#x27;t allow late submissions and I&#x27;ll get a 0.</p><p id="ad37ea41-c22f-4a20-b1cb-67c6430ceeb1" class="">Then I woke up, and I realized it was co-op thats due tues and it&#x27;s currently mon.

Let me establish a few people. C is a girl, about mid 20&#x27;s. S is a boy, also about mid 20&#x27;s. D is a boy, about mid 20&#x27;s. Uh T is a boy, about mid 30&#x27;s? B and M are girls, mid 20&#x27;s. I think that&#x27;s all you need to know.</p><p id="1b96ee81-8a61-4e6a-8dc4-d6bd7ce7967d" class="">So C,S, D, me, and 2 other people, I think T and someone else were going on a road trip. I remember 2 cars outside my house, and we were packing and getting ready to leave. C and S already left the house, D and I were dragging behind. I was ready to leave and I remember seeing D putting on socks or smthing. He seemed... franctic. I went outside first and we were waiting. Then, while waiting, I wel back in the house, went to the freezer, and got 6 popsicles. 3 were longer than the other 3. I started handing them out in the car to C, S, and 1 other person. We were wondering where T and D were, so we went to the backyard. Here&#x27;s where it gets weird.</p><p id="99b0912b-bf56-4cf1-8873-2312a4621067" class="">D and his mom were digging a hole further from us to the left, but immediately, we saw T. He was also digging I think? I think they were burying skeletons, as if they just killed someone and are trying to hide the body. We asked T what he was doing and he said something like this &quot;I&#x27;m making myself remembered. When we die, we die! Our lives are over and no one will remember us! I&#x27;m creating ART! by burying this skeleton into the stone underground, it&#x27;ll undergo erosion and after a while, it will be discovered. People will learn and start to remember me for my art.&quot; He was clearly losing it. I remember seeing his &#x27;art&#x27;, it was a giant stone wall, half buried in the ground, with a skeleton crucified to it.</p><p id="17279961-f6c9-4a42-9309-80a649aaf9cc" class="">We then turned to D, who was digging a hole with I think his mom. His mom seemed to be working hard, while he was disturbed. He was throwing rice in the hole, or it might have been shards of bones, idk. He was also talking about how life is short and I think how he was stressed and commited crimes? I remember looking over him and wondering if this changes my perspective of him, if his crimes made me want to like him less. I don&#x27;t think I reached a conclusion, but he hobbled away into the camera. It was then that I realized this we were filming all of this. I then wondered if these maniacal acts were solely for the camera or if they were actually distraught.</p><p id="0bc5eb58-1753-421a-bd8f-1c8be331bc54" class="">But, it appears that we&#x27;ve eaten up to much time, and B and M had to start their video segment in the backyard. When they started, the fencing in my backyard suddenly fell away, revealing that my backyard was surrounded by greenscreen. The green screen then turned into a majestic mountainous view. I think we planned this as a surprise for M, as she wanted to do something related to mountains but couldn&#x27;t. She was starstruck. I then realized that the digging and the speech by D and T were mere distractions so the green screen could be set up. But I still couldn&#x27;t shake off the feeling of genuine distopia that D and T generated.</p><p id="971a609d-404c-4ce3-b7f9-e57c337ceeb0" class="">And then I awoke.</p><hr id="04f22397-bbc7-4e26-b515-a8923d1f9eec"/><blockquote id="e8b84780-31e9-4e08-b6b6-41a8e109ffbc" class="">Nationals - Feb 7 2021</blockquote><p id="e86da49c-95f3-4b20-a99d-fe0dae7df96e" class="">We were at Niagara nationals. We came out of the subway station like thing, then we walked outside. The buildings were gorgeously modern, so were the floors. We entered the Eatery. I remembered this place. This place we came to last nationals, but I didn&#x27;t buy anything. This time I promised to buy something. On the right, right when we go in was a Tim&#x27;s, but they didn&#x27;t sell Tim&#x27;s stuff. Forwards, there was like a buffet stand, with BeaverTails. Or maybe pizza with brown sauce, but I think it looked sweet and I was really excited. It reminded me of nostalgic Bridlewood Mall vibes, incadescent light, quiet, warm, and some quiet background noise.</p><p id="c9cabbce-03a1-418d-a789-29b7e0b603f5" class="">I went to buy something from Tim&#x27;s. The cashier instructed me on how to make the meal. There was a tortilla in front of me on a grill, and a ladle dipped in some hot caramel sauce on the right. I took the ladle and drizzled its contents over the tortilla. I looked over at Ms.Chang and said something.</p><p id="d9b3e663-8ae4-47a4-89eb-2c197fe67239" class="">Then I awoke.</p><hr id="24e1ae1f-6f29-4393-8466-28a5e174ed28"/><blockquote id="fef169f5-6332-4a35-b210-52e65cf2c816" class="">The Cathedral - Feb 6 2021</blockquote><p id="54f95715-984a-4f13-8f49-aea463ee6497" class="">I was in a cathedral that had 2 main rooms, it looked really cool inside, i feel like the cathedral was peanut shaped. A bunch of kids were lined up the walls, in teams, kind of like the balloon battle at Tamarack. I feel like I was a leader, but Abishan I think was the big leader of our group. Then the cathedral morphed to a gymnasium, someone yelled start, then we ran left into a hallway, made some weird turns, then wound up on the stage. </p><p id="cf2246e4-7233-4489-94e5-8163b966a3d8" class="">This was some great race type activity, then Abishan became some white guy, and he and 2 other members of our team got skydiving outfits, nodded at each other, then went out the gym. I stayed back to do a challenge with diodes I think, operation, and battleship. The white guys came back and we checked off how close we were to finishing.

It was a large open concept with a lounge chaise near the middle. I looked down the stairs at everything below us. It was a huge house, brightly lit. This is what I want when I grow old.</p><p id="51932113-5b84-4196-8f85-69b1e00e2584" class="">The second dream was a super modern house. It was sunny, and the house was near a beach. All the walls were made of glass, and I remember flying up to the top, where the top of the house was connected to the rest by a road. I remember a red bouncy ball. I remember thinking, this is the modern future life I want.</p><p id="7ac39917-7f4d-4d0e-8e40-d5529bb0d2bf" class="">The 3rd dream was weird. I entered a big cabin near the woods. I think I was late and my friends were already partying. I was in the basement I think, and it was dark, like rainy dark. I remember thinking to be quiet so the pit bulls don&#x27;t attack me. I made my way up the stairs, and I think I saw the parents sleeping in the living room. I went up more stairs, and I saw a brightly lit bedroom, where all my friends were gathered, so I joined them.</p><p id="f7215bed-5449-4737-bb85-a4409157082f" class="">There was another part, I don&#x27;t know if it was a different dream, but I think it was the same house. I went in through the side, and was running around. The house&#x27;s layout was weird, I remember tiny rooms that only served as places between other rooms? It was like a labrynth.</p><p id="6510b809-4e74-4031-b502-0306a67fcfa0" class="">There was another one, It was a more modern spanish house I would say, I remember playing hide and seek with a robot butler I think.
